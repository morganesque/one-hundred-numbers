        		        <p>What's that? A call from 2008? They want their technology back?</p><p>Yes, I know it should be HTML or something right? Well, I did it in Flash because for me it was quick to at the time.</p><p>Yes, it would be fairly simple now to redo it in HTML but it works for the purpose as it is. Maybe I'll convert it if I add a lot to it. It would be nice to have it work on the iPad.</p>

    		        <p>In case you don't quite know what to do:</p>
    		        <p>&bull;&nbsp;The squares down the left hand side turn the multiples of that number on and off.</p>
    		        <p>&bull;&nbsp;The bottom square (cut in half) turns them all on and all off (depending on which half you click).</p>
    		        <p>&bull;&nbsp;The dark semi-circles at the top control how many columns are showing.</p>
        		    <p>&bull;&nbsp;If you've got any ideas about how I could improve or add to it, tweet me <a href="http://twitter.com/morganesque">@morganesque</a>.</p>

    		        <h2>Explanation</h2>
    		        <p>I made this for my kids who are just kind of approaching maths and numbers at various levels at the moment. I think with maths in particular getting a sense for the patterns and the relationships between numbers is so important, just as important as memorising the methods you need to use to get to the right answer.</p><p>I was hoping to make something which would be simple and easy to use but with enough in it to provoke some of those little "Aha!" moments I remember having about maths when I was young.</p>
